## Interests

Outside of work, I like to keep active and particularly enjoy cycling (although having recently moved from Lincolnshire to London, this hobby has become a fair bit scarier). I am also an avid snowboarder and like to try and get away when I can. I have previously completed a snowboard instructing qualification in Canada.
