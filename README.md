**Who I Am**

I am a former inhabitant of the world of tech support who has seen the light and decided to learn to code with Makers Academy. In my past life, I was highy adept at using problem solving skills to help customers get to grips with their software. I'm now hoping to put those skills to good use as a junior developer.

## Experience

**ScholarPack** (03/2016 to 07/2017)    

*First Line Technical Analyst* 

ScholarPack is a small but rapidly growing software business that produces a management information system (MIS) for primary schools. During my time at the company, I was part of a five person team that was responsible for managing all of our customers' support needs. Whilst I was in this role, ScholarPack doubled its customer base. Despite this, we managed to maintain customer support satisfaction ratings above 90 percent.

- Acted as the first point of contact for all customers requiring software support (both phone and live chat).
- Worked with customers to resolve non-technical issues and provide general software guidance. This required both a thorough understanding of the product and the education sector that it was built to support.
- Directly worked with our technical team to ensure that any technical issues were resolved promptly. Also acted as a conduit for customer feedback on areas of the product that required improvement.

**JPC Commercial Services** (03/2014 to 03/2016)   
 
 *Accounts Assistant* 
 
 After my time at Charlotte House, I moved in to the accounts team for the hotel's parent company. I was part of a small team that was responsible for maintaining the accounts of three hotels and a busy public house.
 
 - Solely responsible for looking after the company payroll for more than 70 employees.
 - Actively worked with suppliers to reduce business costs.
 - Gained a good understanding of best practice in accounting.
  
  **Charlotte House Hotel, Lincoln** (03/2014 to 09/2015)
 
 *Hotel Receptionist and Assistant Manager* 
  
  Charlotte House is a boutique hotel that specializes in weddings and large events.
 
- Managed the hotelâ€™s reception and housekeeping teams. This involved training, rota management and ensuring that all    employees maintained high standards in their work.
- Provided professional and friendly service to all hotel guests.
- Took responsibility for accurately recording and banking all hotel takings.
- Assisted the general manager to ensure that all events ran smoothly. The hotel would often host multiple weddings over the course of a weekend. This required working to very tight schedules to keep customers with very high expectations happy.

*Contact Centre Agent*

This was a temporarary contract for a large utilities provider.

- Developed a highly professional phone manner.

**Various Roles** (2007 to 2011)

-During my time at university I was employed in a number of temporary positions, primarily during the holiday periods. These were either hospitality or factory roles. Through these, I was able to develop the basic skills necessary to thrive in the workplace, such as effective time keeping and the ability to work as part of a team. I am happy to provide more specific information about these roles if required.


## Interests

Outside of work, I like to keep active and particularly enjoy cycling (although having recently moved from Lincolnshire to London, this hobby has become a fair bit scarier). I am also an avid snowboarder and like to try and get away when I can. I have previously completed a snowboard instructing qualification in Canada.
