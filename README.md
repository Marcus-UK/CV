I am a former inhabitant of the world of tech support and life long lover of technology who recently finished a coding boot camp with Makers Academy. Through Makers, I learnt to love the challenge of crafting clean, high quality code. I’m now looking to put the skills I learnt to good use in my first role as a junior developer.

## Interests

Outside of work, I like to keep active and particularly enjoy cycling (although having recently moved from Lincolnshire to London, this hobby has become a fair bit scarier). I am also an avid snowboarder and like to try and get away when I can. I have previously completed a snowboard instructing qualification in Canada.
